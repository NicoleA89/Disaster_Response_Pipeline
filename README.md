In this project various disaster messages were investigated. A model for an API which classifies disaster messages. A model was built with which messages can be classified that were sent following a catastrophic event. The project includes a web app that can be filled with new messages that are then being classified to certain categories (e.g. weather related, first aid, etc.). The web app also displays visualizations of the data:
